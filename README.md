# Project Motivation
When faced with tracking one’s expenditure and saving money, an individual could either not be bothered or not have the tools available to do so reliably. 

Many feel like it is a hassle to enter their expenditure and that they are alone in the journey of saving. However, we feel that an individual should understand their income and spending to have maximum control over their money.

# User Stories
Students mostly live off allowances from parents/guardians which is often not a large amount, hence they have to budget accordingly. With our mobile application, students can see their expenditures and the categories in which they spend the most. They can then take the necessary actions to cut down on expenditure in those categories.

Working Adults have to balance both income and expenditure, making sure they do not spend more than they earn (i.e expenditure > income). Thus they can enter their income for the month and track their daily expenditure to make sure the above does not occur. The mobile app can also send reminders when the user’s expenditure is 90% of their income to remind users to cut down on expenditure.

Students/Working Adults might forget to update their daily expenditure, at the end of every day, the mobile app will send reminders for users to enter their spending for the day unless this feature is turned off.

With our mobile app, users will be able to visualize their expenditure in terms of categories, or as a percentage of their income which makes saving more straightforward as the data is readily presented, hence no calculation is required on their part.

Users often feel like they are alone in their saving journey, as people don’t often talk about how much they save/how they save, the introduction of the leaderboards/friends system allows users to observe and even compete with their family/friends.
